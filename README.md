# disc_golf_score_card
Disc golf score card implemented using kivy and python. The goal was to create an app.

# Final App
While quite ugly the app is fully functional.

To build the project into an app see the instructions on kivy's website: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/packaging-android.html

# Implementation
Disc golf score card with support for multiple player and any length course.

The app will score and provide current score of all players. 

If needed the ability to update previous holes is implemented.

# How to run
The Program does not need to be ran as an app it can be ran on the command line.

python main.py

This will have all the same functionality as the app would.

Doing this will have kivy as a requirement.

See https://kivy.org for more information.
